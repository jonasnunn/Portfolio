# Overview

This web app is a personal portfolio to present my project in an interesting and cool way. I used Vite to make this project and tested it using npm. To start this project up use "npm run dev".

My purpose in writing this application was twofold. First was to present my work to others in a user friendly way. Second was to familiarize myself with react and practice good practices in it.
